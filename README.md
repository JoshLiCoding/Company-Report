# Company-Report
A website that automatically provides information about companies using stock tickers

https://joshlicoding.github.io/Company-Report/#/

Used React.js with Material UI. Also implemented FinnHub API and react-chartjs-2

(At https://joshlicoding.github.io/Company-Report/#/google, there is a legacy sample company report of Google in a different format including revenues, ESGs, and basic financials. These were mostly pulled manually instead of using an API)

## Description
Data includes company profile, stock details & prices, media stories and peers

Any URL not directed to homepage or the Google page will be routed to a 404 webpage

Note that there is some delay while retrieving from FinnHub API, particularly for media stories and peers.
